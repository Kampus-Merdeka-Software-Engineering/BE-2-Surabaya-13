## 1. Installation
To begin, you need to install Sequelize and its CLI tool. Open your terminal and run the following commands:
```
npm install sequelize sequelize-cli --save
```
This installs Sequelize and the Sequelize CLI as dependencies in your project.

## 2. Initializing Sequelize
After installation, initialize Sequelize in your project by running:
```
npx sequelize-cli init
```
This creates the necessary Sequelize directory structure in your project.

## 3. Creating Migrations
Migrations help you manage the database schema changes over time. To create a migration, use the following command:
```
npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name your_migration_name
```
Replace "your_migration_name" with a descriptive name for your migration.

## 4. Running Migrations
Execute the migrations to apply the changes to your database:
```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```
This ensures that your database is updated with the latest schema changes.

## 5. Running Creating Seeders
Seeders allow you to populate your database with initial data. Create a seeder using:
```
npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name your_seeder_name
```
Replace "your_seeder_name" with a meaningful name for your seeder.

## 6. Running Creating Seeders
Run the seeders to populate your database with initial data:
```
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```
This command executes all seeders, ensuring your database has the necessary initial data.
